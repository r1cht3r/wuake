wuake
=====

This is a recompiled version of the Wuake lua script, originally from http://www.tonyivanov.se/posts/78


I didn't like that it used the F10 key originally. It's set to use the Windows Appkey. 


Hotkey is set by $hotkey, line 38 of Wuake.au3. Destination cygwin directory is set by shell on line 3 of console.xml and init_dir pointed to your Cygwin homedir. If you want to compile or change the hotkey, you will need AutoIt3, a free download from here http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/
